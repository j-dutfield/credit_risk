Date: 14/09/23

Personal project to learn about credit risk as an ML problem.

This notebook is only intended to be a brief experiment to reach a baseline ML model performance, and largely skips through many of the usual steps of a data science project (EDA, feature analysis etc).

Requirements:

- Python 3.9
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- sklearn
- xgboost
